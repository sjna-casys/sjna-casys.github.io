I am currently 	a Postdoctoral Fellow in [HPArch Group](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://hyesoon.github.io/). Prior to Georgia tech, I received a Ph.D in School of Computing from [KAIST](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) (2023), advised by Prof. [Jaehyuk Huh](https://jaehyuk-huh.github.io/index.html).

My research interests lie in GPU architecture, trusted computing, heterogeneous systems, distributed computing, and systems for machine learning. During my Ph.D. studies, I focused on building secure architecture to provide a trusted execution environment(TEE) on accelerators such as GPUs, and NPUs with low-performance overhead.
Currently, I am actively engaged in extending my research field to address various challenges in the multi-GPU architecture, hardware security, and accelerating large language models (LLMs).


**I am currently looking for full-time job opportunities in industry.**
